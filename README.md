# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor
The project required much attention to detail to both the index and style files.
Inside of the index file I had to rename various div tags to more updated tags such as "footer" "aside"
and "nav" tags to make more clear to future developers what exactly each section is. Also had to change
a H tag that was mislabeled as well as remove an unnecessary img tag at the end on h3. Alt tags were given to existing img tags and linked below the style.css i created a new link to the images folder.
On the CSS file changes were made to group various classes with the same effect tags to condense the amount
of lines that were required.
